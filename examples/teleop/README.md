# Tele-operation Interface

This example demonstrates how to build remote control UI on a robot with motor
controls, accelerometer readings, and a wifi strength sensor.

This example is implemented using Elm with ports.

## Usage

Run `npm run watch` and visit `localhost:8000` in a browser.

You should see an interface that looks like this after a few seconds:

![teledemo ui](doc/teledemo-ui.png?raw=true)

You may need to enable "allow audio and video" in your browser to get a live
video stream.

![select allow and video](doc/allow-audio-video.png?raw=true)
