# Viam SDK Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to connect to a robot and operate a motor on it.

## Usage

Run `npm start` and visit `localhost:8000` in a browser. Press the button to execute the logic defined in `src/main.ts`.

Edit `src/main.ts` to change the robot logic being run. Edit `static/index.html` to change the layout of the app.

### Base Project Template

This example assumes that you are working inside the Viam TypeScript SDK repository. If you want to use this example as a base for your project, make the following changes:

* Remove the `preinstall: ...` line from `package.json`
* Install the SDK: `npm install @viamrobotics/sdk@latest`
