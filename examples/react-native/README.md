# React Native & Viam's TypeScript SDK

This example demonstrates how to connect to a robot using a React Native app. For a summary of changes required to use the TypeScript SDK with React Native, view the [Configuration](#Configuration) section.

## Table of Contennts

1. [Usage](#Usage)
2. [Configuration](#Configuration)

## Usage

- Run `npm install`
- Open `App.tsx` and update the `host` and API `credentials`.
- Run `npm run {ios|android}`
  - If running on iOS, you may have to install dependencies: `cd ios && pod install && popd`
  - If running on Android, you may have to export Android tool locations:
    ```sh
    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
    ```

## Configuration

Using Viam's TypeScript SDK with React Native requires some configurations. They are outlined below. Copying this project as a template is a good approach given the dependencies and polyfills requried. In the future, we hope to minimize the work neeed to get started here.

### Dependencies

The following direct dependencies are required:

- fast-text-encoding
- react-native-fast-encoder
- react-native-fetch-api
- react-native-url-polyfill
- react-native-webrtc
- web-streams-polyfill

In addition, polyfills and a custom gRPC Transport are provided at `polyfills.native.ts` and `transport.ts` respectively.

#### `App.tsx`

The `App.tsx` file was updated to include the following polyfills and updates:

- Polyfills:

  ```js
  import {polyfills} from './polyfills';
  polyfills();
  ```

- GRPC connection configuration

  ```js
  import { GrpcWebTransportOptions } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";
  import { createXHRGrpcWebTransport } from './transport';

  globalThis.VIAM = {
    GRPC_TRANSPORT_FACTORY: (opts: GrpcWebTransportOptions) => {
      return createXHRGrpcWebTransport(opts);
    }
  };
  ```

#### `metro.config.js`

The `metro.config.js` file was also updated. `react-native` and `react-native-webrtc` require conflicting versions of the library `event-target-shim`. By updating the `metro.config.js` file, the Metro Bundler knows how to package this library properly.

### Android Configuration

The `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission was added to the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```
